What is this file?
The 
isolation_forest.pkl
 is a serialized machine learning model saved using Python's joblib library. It contains a trained Isolation Forest algorithm specifically designed for anomaly detection in financial transactions.

Model Specifications
Core Algorithm: Isolation Forest
Type: Unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm
Principle: Isolates anomalies by randomly selecting features and split values
Advantage: Efficient for high-dimensional data without requiring labeled examples
Model Parameters
n_estimators: 100 - Uses 100 decision trees (ensemble)
contamination: 0.02 - Expects 2% of data to be anomalies
random_state: 42 - Ensures reproducible results
max_samples: auto - Automatically determines sample size per tree
max_features: 1.0 - Uses all available features
bootstrap: False - No bootstrap sampling
Model State
Status: âœ… Fully Trained and Ready
Features: Trained on 3 input features
Trees: Contains 100 fitted decision trees
Sample Size: 256 samples per estimator
File Properties
Size: 1.17 MB (1,223,736 bytes)
Format: Python pickle file (.pkl)
Location:

How It Works
Training Process
Data Input: Trained on transaction features:
Transaction_Amount
Average_Transaction_Amount
Frequency_of_Transactions
Tree Building: Each of the 100 trees:
Randomly selects features
Creates isolation paths
Shorter paths = more likely anomalies
Anomaly Scoring:
Normal transactions require more splits to isolate
Anomalous transactions are isolated quickly
Prediction Logic
python
# Model returns -1 for anomalies, +1 for normal
prediction = model.predict(transaction_data)
# -1 = Anomaly, +1 = Normal
Usage in Your Project
Loading & Prediction
python
# In detect_anomalies.py
model = joblib.load("models/isolation_forest.pkl")
prediction = model.predict(input_data)
anomaly = 1 if prediction[0] == -1 else 0

Model Performance Characteristics
Strengths
Fast Prediction: Efficient for real-time anomaly detection
No Labels Required: Unsupervised learning approach
Robust: Handles outliers well
Scalable: Works with large datasets
Configuration Rationale
2% Contamination: Realistic for financial fraud (1-3% typical)
100 Trees: Good balance of accuracy vs. performance
3 Features: Focused on most predictive transaction patterns
Real-World Application
This model is designed to flag transactions that are:

Unusually large compared to user's history
Inconsistent with typical transaction patterns
Anomalous in frequency or timing
The 1.17 MB size indicates a well-trained model with sufficient complexity to capture transaction patterns while remaining efficient for production use.

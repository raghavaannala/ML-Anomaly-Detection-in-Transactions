## Introduction

In today's digital world, transaction data is abundant. However, not all transactions are normal. Some may reveal fraudulent activity or errors that require immediate attention. This project aims to build a robust model to detect these anomalies using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This repository includes:

- Data preprocessing scripts
- Machine learning models
- Evaluation metrics
- Visualization tools

By using this project, you can easily detect anomalies in transaction data, helping organizations maintain integrity and trust in their financial operations.

## Technologies Used

This project employs several technologies, including:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- imbalanced-learn

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project consists of transaction records. Each record includes features such as:

- Transaction ID
- Amount
- Timestamp
- Merchant
- User ID

These features help the model identify patterns and anomalies effectively.

## Model Overview

This project primarily uses the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection. This unsupervised learning technique is effective for identifying outliers in high-dimensional datasets. 

### Key Steps in the Model:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that may help in detecting anomalies.
3. **Model Training**: Train the Isolation Forest model on the prepared dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics like precision and recall.

## Results

The model successfully identifies anomalies in transaction data. The evaluation metrics indicate a high level of accuracy, making it a reliable tool for detecting irregularities.

### Visualization

Graphs and charts help visualize the results. Here are some examples:
